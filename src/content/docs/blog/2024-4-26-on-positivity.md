I think I’m often seen as a “hater,” and I worry about this perception. I hold some strong opinions about popular technologies. I’m not afraid to voice those opinions when I hear strangers espousing their love for Kubernetes or how gRPC changed everything for their team. I’ve been on the other side of this kind of discussion in online communities, especially when it comes to serverless. My reaction has been to shut out this type of negativity and dismiss it as misinformed, jaded, grumpy, or argumentative. I don’t think that’s fair.

I worry about how I’m perceived because I think the attributes I’ve described are those of pessimists. Despite my bouts of negativity, I think of myself as an optimist. I’m not a “doomer,” and I don’t believe that misguided or misplaced effort was the source of technology about which I voice opinions. While I may complain about the complexity of Kubernetes, I don’t deny its impact or importance. Nor do I think fools created it. My willingness to talk about it stems from my belief that smart people are investing effort into something combined with my desire for them to succeed. I believe in the ability of others to do better and improve on something important that technologists are talking about and using daily.

To many people, this duality of “hater” and optimistic proponent will seem like a moral justification or cognitive dissonance on my part. Maybe that’s good feedback for me to be perceived as I intend, but I don’t feel the need to change solely because others disagree. I think it’s important to hold strong opinions “weakly” and change your beliefs when shown contradicting evidence, but I don’t think that should mean you should yield to popular belief or allow your tastes to be shaped by convenience.

Ultimately, we have a finite amount of attention, and opinions, negative or otherwise, should be saved for something that matters — something worth building. I personally think that this is where the saying “there’s no such thing as bad PR” comes from because the indifference of others is really a statement that what you’re doing doesn’t matter to them. This is why I think it’s an optimist’s job to cherish your haters — it means you’re working on something that matters, even if somebody thinks you’re doing the job wrong.

It can be difficult to find this kind of optimism when you have to choose the tone in which you read others’ complaints and arguments. It’s easy to dismiss commenters. It’s convenient to read hatred or anger rather than passion and connection. Maybe the internet has given me a thicker skin than others, but an optimistic filter helps. Rest assured, knowing nobody comments when they don’t care.
