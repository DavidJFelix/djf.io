I've been running a lot lately - my wife and I have made it part of our fitness routine over the past 4 years.
In the past, I had run a bit - track in grade school, and periodically at the gym or a charity 5k, but nothing as serious as how I run now.
Last year, I completed my first marathon and I think I can say now that I'm officially "a runner".
Running has a lot of different appeals to different people and I've been reflecting a bit on what that means to me and why I like running.

## Finding your pace

One of the interesting challenges running has exposed me to is that its an endurance sport in many ways, any way you slice it.
Regardless of distance, you'll always have stretch your endurance on your heart rate, muscle fatigue, and even training regularity.
Overtraining can mean pulling a muscle or getting too sore to run which impacts your schedule.
Overrunning can mean exhausting yourself early in a run and not having energy for the end.

On the other hand, if you don't push these goals you'll have a hard time progressing -- you can't run longer, further, or faster if you don't run some combination of longer, further, or faster.
Finding your pace means maintaining your fiteness and staying disciplined.
Often the hardest part about running is just going outside and running every day you say that you will.
Regularity helps build your ability and finding a macro-pace for your training schedule may be just as important as your mile time.

## Progression

In running, progression is similar to weight lifting in that you'll be surprised at how quickly you progress in some ways and feel defeated in other ways.
For example, adding miles goes pretty quickly, with many marathon programs going from 8 to 22 miles in 18 weeks.
That's close to a mile per week further on a long run!
This always surprises me, coming from weighlifting where I've spent that long and only doubled a lift or added 30%.

But improving your mile pace might take just as long for a 10% increase.
Improving my pace has been a long term side effect of running, never a noticiable progression.
Regardless, I can see and feel the benefit of my effort, applied consistently and regularly in reaching my goals.
For me this feels extremely rewarding.
