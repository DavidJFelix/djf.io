I've been running about four to five times a week these days and I think it's safe to say that it's part of my routine.
My wife and I have made a deliberate effort to make this fitness activity it part of our morning over the past few years.
Up until recently, I had only run periodically -â€” track in grade school (200m, 400m), on the tread mill at the gym, or a charity 5k -- but nothing serious.
Last year, I finished my first marathon[^1] and I feel comfortable calling myself a "runner"[^2].
In this process of becoming a "runner" I've talked to a lot of people who run about how it appeals to them, and I've been reflecting on and why I personally like running.

## Finding your pace

When I ran track in grade school, I mostly did sprints and ran as fast as I could for some distance, typically tiring out around 200m but sometimes being forced to continue for 400m, regardless.
It's taken me until now to realize that even with a relatively short distance and time frame, running is an endurance sport in multiple aspects.
Regardless of distance or time, in order to effectively train you'll have to stretch your endurance.
That might translate to working on your heart rate, muscle fatigue, regularity, recovery, or speed.
Overrunning can mean exhausting yourself early in a run and not having energy for the end.
Overtraining can mean pulling a muscle or getting too sore to run, which impacts your recovery and training schedule.

On the other hand, if you don't push these goals, you'll have a hard time progressing - you can't run longer, further, or faster if you don't run some combination of longer, further, or faster [^3].
If you take a break from running (say, seasonally) or rest after an injury, you might notice a step backwards while you get back in the groove.
Finding your pace means maintaining your fitness and staying disciplined to a schedule as much as it does not overtraining - it's a balance between commitment and setting achievable goals.
For undertrainers, often, the most challenging part about running is just going outside and running every day you say you will.
Regularity helps build your ability, and helps you find a "macro-pace" for your training schedule.
I think this this is actually more important to overall running success than your mile time or how far you can run on a single day.
My mantra for finding my pace is, "the day serves the week, the week serves the month, the month serves the year," to remind myself that you can't have a good week without good days but also one good day that you overexert might harm your week.
I find that thinking like this also applies well to a race, where the step serves the segment, the segment serves the mile and the mile serves the race.
If you overrun a mile it can harm your race time.

There's a zen to finding your pace.
When progress seems slow and you want to overwork, you can remind yourself to think bigger and serve that goal.
When the goal seems insurmountable and you want to give up, you can remind yourself that it's just one day but you need that one day to make the year-long goal.

## Progression

Before I got into running, I went to the gym and did free weights and weight lifting.
In a lot of ways, progression in running is very similar to weight lifting.
Early on, you'll be surprised at how quickly you progress, but there are some challenges that just prove incredibly difficult[^4].
With a good program, you can add distance to your runs pretty quickly, with marathon training programs taking your weekly long run from 6 miles to 20 miles in 18 weeks.
That's almost a mile per week progression for distance.
It's a palpable change that feels extremely rewarding and helps encourage contining discipline to complete the program.

The pace of progression always astounds me coming from weigh lifting, where it feels like progress is slower.
Maybe it's an easy-to-follow program or just the way you count mileage that allows you to account for the change.
But more similarly to the pace I felt in weight lifting -- its taken me a year to shave a minute off of my average mile pace when running distance.
Improving my pace has been a long-term side effect of running, rarely with a noticeable progression.
Using apps like Strava or Apple Fitness/Health I can track the trend, but the slope is so gradual, with so many bumps and returns back to a slower pace that it's often hard to give myself credit.
Regardless, I can see and feel the benefit of my effort, which I have applied consistently and regularly to reach my goals.
For me, this feels extremely rewarding, even if it takes a long timeline.

## Comparison - the Thief of Joy

The more you run the more you'll see other runners and make note of their times and pace.
If you run a race, you can run for a time (and ostensibly to win), but unless you're an excellent runner already (I'm not), you'll likely have a hard time placing well even in your division.
To me, there's more a zen to this.
It's a practice of humility and acceptance that others around you are also making an effort and may, by some metric, be better than you.
It's zen because it forces you to rid yourself of the common "all-or-nothing" mental block and accept good even if it's clearly inferior or imperfect.
Even if (when) others run faster or further than you, you can still set your best time.
You can still reach your goal and have your achievement.
You can still have a good outcome, relative to your own experience, surrounded by people who sacrificed more, worked harder, had more time, had fewer other focuses, or had more to prove.
It's not about them, it's about you, and finding that peace comes easy when you have many grueling hours of training and racing to think about it.

It's been said that comparison is the thief of joy, and to an extent I think that is true, but through running I've found empathy for the effort of others.
It's easier to consider how impressive running several marathons a year or a sub-3-hour (or even sub-4-hour) marathon time is once you've put in the work to run one yourself.
I think that envying accomplishment can strip you of your own joy, but to compare is human and appreicating tradeoffs can contextualize the effort.
Runners I see daily are often out regardless of if I start at 6 or 7am -- are they running an hour more than me every morning?
Once you see what it takes to get to each level, you either trade your time and other aspects of your life to get better or you find solace that this isn't a trade you're willing to make.
You've found your pace and it's okay to appreicate something that'ts within your reach but not your ultimate desire.
You might do something similar to olympic runners but your goals aren't the same.
If you want to be in shape and wake up daily, those things don't require you to become an olympian.

To the people who run slower, your achievement may seem incredible.
To the people who won't wake up and run in the morning, even an exhausted, complainy, half-assed run might look disciplined.
It's all relative, and when you compare upward you don't give yourself the credit you deserve.
Remember the people you pass when you look forward at the people who pass you.

## "Foot"notes:
[^1]: My time wasn't great, but I ran almost all of it and ran the last few miles.
[^2]: I feel like this and many labels have their own expectations and even running several times a week I didn't consider myself a "runner".
[^3]: Training programs often integrate a mix of speed and distance work to improve your time on distance runs.
[^4]: For me, this was adding weight to my bench press.
