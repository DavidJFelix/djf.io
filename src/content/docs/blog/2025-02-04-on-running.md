I've been running a lot lately. My wife and I have made it part of our fitness routine for the past four years.
I have run a bit in the past —track in grade school and periodically at the gym or a charity 5k—but nothing as seriously as how I run now.
I completed my first marathon last year, and now I think I can officially call myself a runner.
Running appeals to many different people, and I've been reflecting on what that means and why I like running.

## Finding your pace

One of the interesting challenges running has exposed me to is that it's an endurance sport in many ways, any way you slice it.
Regardless of distance, you'll always have to stretch your endurance on your heart rate, muscle fatigue, and even training regularity.
Overtraining can mean pulling a muscle or getting too sore to run, which impacts your schedule.
Overrunning can mean exhausting yourself early in a run and not having energy for the end.

On the other hand, if you don't push these goals, you'll have a hard time progressing- you can't run longer, further, or faster if you don't run some combination of longer, further, or faster.
Finding your pace means maintaining your fitness and staying disciplined.
Often, the most challenging part about running is just going outside and running every day you say you will.
Regularity helps build your ability, and finding a macro-pace for your training schedule may be as important as your mile time.

## Progression

Progression in running is similar to weight lifting. You'll be surprised at how quickly you progress in some ways and feel defeated in others.
For example, adding miles goes pretty quickly, with many marathon programs going from 8 to 22 miles in 18 weeks.
That's close to a mile per week further in the long run!
This always surprises me, coming from weightlifting, where I've spent that long and only doubled a lift or added 30%.

But improving your mile pace might take just as long for a 10% increase.
Improving my pace has been a long-term side effect of running, never a noticeable progression.
Regardless, I can see and feel the benefit of my effort, which I have applied consistently and regularly to reach my goals.
For me, this feels extremely rewarding.
