I've been running a lot lately - my wife and I have made it part of our fitness routine over the past 4 years.
In the past, I had run a bit - track in grade school, and periodically at the gym or a charity 5k, but nothing as serious as how I run now.
Last year, I completed my first marathon and I think I can say now that I'm officially "a runner".
Running has a lot of different appeals to different people and I've been reflecting a bit on what that means to me and why I like running.

## Finding your pace

One of the interesting challenges running has exposed me to is that its an endurance sport in many ways, any way you slice it.
Regardless of distance, you'll always have stretch endurance on heart rate, muscle fatigue, and even training regularity.
