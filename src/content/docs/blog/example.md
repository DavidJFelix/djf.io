## Expectations

As a passionate software engineer, this blog isn't the blog I wanted to build.
I've started building this blog a number of times and this isn't what I wanted, but it's here, and the very fact that you're reading these words is evidence that I wrote a blog.
But those achievements are different -- building a blog and writing a blog, and part of the reason you're able to read this blog at all is that I stopped building the blog and just wrote the blog instead.

For some personal history, I enjoy writing about software development, technology, industry practices, and startups.
In the past these have been unexpectedly long posts or discussions in discord, and I wanted to build a place for me to express my ideas in long form, so I set out to build a blog that could house those ideas. In my mind I wanted to change how I wrote and I needed a platform.
I set out to build a blog but not to write it.
It's finally here and my feelings are mixed.

For me, I think others as well, dissatisfaction is a difficult feeling to accept when shipping a product.
Reid Hoffman famously said:

> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, youâ€™ve launched too late.

But I think a lot of the wisdom I've heard about a perfectionist mindset has felt like it was instructing me to ignore the dissatisfaction and embarrassment or power through it with force of will.
This advice can be hard to stomach because without a "why" behind it, to me, it feels like any other [positivity or prosperity grift](is there a real name for this?).
I think that powering through the feeling can get you to the goal, but ignoring it completely fails to learn from it or reassure you that the goal truly is noble or worthwhile.

## Goals

Writing a blog and building a blog are different goals.
If I were trying to be more honest with what each goal was I might instead say "building a blog platform" and "writing and publishing blog posts".
Earlier in this post, I intentionally didn't phrase these goals honestly to demonstrate how easy it is to conflate two different ideas.
For much of this project I've been conflating them myself.

For engineers it can be very easy to see just one side of your requirements, the product.
As experts on the product side, its an easy trap to hold the product to stringent standards, when in reality, the existential requirement for the product is its audience (aka customer, reader, user, etc.)
If a product fails to ever reach this audience, engineering failed to build the product, regardless of the features and quality it fails with.
As software engineering experts it's disappointing that no amount of quality, expertise or taste alone can save a product; however the silver lining is that shipping is functionally very easy, despite how emotionally difficult it can be.

The difference between "building a blog platform" and "writing and publishing blog posts" is shipping.
In the past I might object here that it's possible to ship a blog platform, but as stated previously the audience is an existential requirement, and building a blog platform is shipping a product to myself first while writing the blog posts (with or without that platform) is shipping a product to readers.

Writing software for yourself can feel really good because you're the audience and the engineer -- it short circuits shipping with none of the vulnerability, but its important not to conflate a goal that looks similar to your actual goal.
Keeping the actual product and audience in mind matters and it helps to set goals that are specific and clear to prevent yourself from conflating non-goals or inflating your goal into something bigger and hairier.

## Reality

At this point I think many software engineers will see the "why" behind ignoring aspects of technical product building because of the similarities it has with feature creep and scope creep in the project management world.
The reality is that nobody can be everywhere all at once, nobody can build everything all at once, and most importantly not all features can be top priority all at once.

Non-technical features are still features and shipping early and often might mean setting aside **almost all** technical features in favor of shipping.
That can feel disappointing; but it's not that engineering does not matter -- it matters a lot, but engineers must make an effort to ship regularly and not block the primary goal with secondary and tertiary goals.
Engineering can be instrumental in some early decisions but more importantly it ensures that later features are kept in mind and that the product doesn't commit itself to a path that needs dramatic correction.

Software engineering and architecting are roles typically surrounded with hairy realities.
Legacy software, myopic decisions, and brownfield systems rarely provide teams with the freedoms that they desire and part of the job is working within those constraints (and arguably, ensuring you complain about them at a reasonable volume).
Engineers, architects, and developers all fantasize about a green field project where they can build all of the rules from scratch.

The reality though, is that the brownfield system still exists because it provides value.
It has already met its existential goal of reaching an audience, despite the choices made and the pain it causes engineering today.
Reality doesn't mean engineers have to give up their craft and build bad software.
It means that green field systems need to be seen not as a blank slate but something being built deliberately.
Rather than planning and building everything all at once to make software that finally doesn't have the warts of legacy (spoiler: it still will), these projects should stake themselves on their existential goal - reaching an audience first.
Secondary goals can still be strong engineering cornerstones, but it's important to build small and continue shipping to users.

## Shipping

Shipping can feel uncomfortable, vulnerable, and embarrassing.
The product is being exposed to its audience and maybe it doesn't meet the tastes or quality standard of its authors.
It's possible the product looks terrible or barely works.

But it's important to remember, it didn't **really** exist before shipping.
It was just an idea that had been elaborately explored.
**Now the product exists.**

#### Shipping isn't as embarrassing as most people expect.

I used to speak at conferences pretty regularly early in my career and that has tapered off.
There's plenty to blame for that, like moving, COVID-19, and getting married but I think realistically the reason that I stopped is that my own tastes and experience developed, and the bar that I set for "what is conference worthy" went up.
Part of this post is my own dedication to speak and write publicly more.

The nature of developing taste and becoming an expert is establishing critical thinking and it's easy to become your own greatest critic.
Self doubt is not a form of humility, it's a form of anxiety.
It's important to remember that when you're shipping a product, the default is that nobody cares.
A bad launch might be met with a few mean comments from a handful of nobodies you've never met, but that isn't a public shaming.
There are plenty of bad products from people and companies who your audience will expect more from.

### Being vulnerable is good.

Your taste and expertise wasn't developed in a vacuum or granted from the ether, it was built up from the learnings and experiences of others.
Insulating your own projects and self-criticizing them may yield something that is inherently "yours" but it is limited by your own ability.
Being vulnerable and shipping means that you question those tastes and validate them with your audience and maybe other peer experts.
The intuition and expertise that an engineer develops through their career is learned.
Early in a career, there is no foundation so everything is learned, but later in a career, past experience can be used to get by.
But past experience is itself an assumption.
It's an assumption that the way you've learned something is completely correct.
It's an assumption that anecdote and rules are a complete view.
By being vulnerable is good engineering because you open yourself to challenge those assumptions and prove them or disprove them; doing so allows you to grow your knowledge; not doing so leads to stagnation and reliance on your early career assumptions being enough to get by.
Being vulnerable and growing your assumptions allows you to continue learning with an expert's view and challenge your early ideas about what is a good product, how it should be built, and what is right.

### Embrace discomfort.

Being uncomfortable isn't always bad.
Sometimes it might be -- it might signal that it's time to do something new or change.
But discomfort can also be a sign of growth at work; it can mean that you're challenging your existing assumptions, stretching your ability, changing and challenging yourself.

As an engineer, I feel like I understand discomfort through dissatisfaction the best, because it's why I build.
If something isn't good enough, I set out to fix it or build something new.
I feel satisfied by fixing the thing that I saw unsuitable.
The discomfort that comes from shipping early is very different -- it's almost an anxiety that I will be dissatisfied with myself or my own creation, the thing I built to scratch that very dissatisfaction itch.

### Shipping is rewarding.

#### Scratchpad

- Validating assumptions is good engineering
- Dedicating yourself to shipping means fewer abandoned projects with nothing to show (i know about this)
- Shipping can be rewarding
